Own stock index:

The reference factors are: inverse volatility (25%), profit probability (50%), and average profit (25%).

The index aims to screen out stocks in the CSI 300 with high profitability, high average returns and low volatility.

After standardization, the comprehensive score is calculated according to the factor weight for ranking. The top 100 of the parent index (CSI 300) were selected for liquid market capitalization weighting.

I didn't do quarterly maintenance, and I weighted the market capitalization and calculated the points to fit the index and then compared it to the CSI 300.
